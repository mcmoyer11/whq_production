Acquisition, Development, and Representation of Linguistic Knowledge

 


INFORMED CONSENT FORM





















You are invited to
participate in a research study that is being conducted by Dr. Kristen Syrett, an
Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics and the Center for
Cognitive Science at Rutgers University – New Brunswick. The purpose of this
research is to investigate what children and adults understand about aspects of
meaning in their native language and how this knowledge is acquired.

 

In this study, we will ask
you to read some words or sentences, or look at some images or videos. You will
be asked to provide your judgment about these materials, make a selection given
certain instructions, or follow the experimenter’s directions to perform some
action with the materials. Your reaction time may be monitored. You may provide
your consent to be audio and/or video-recorded. Over the course of this
particular study, approximately 20 to 100 participants will participate. The
study lasts between 20 and 45 minutes. 

 

You will receive course
credit (extra credit or points towards the fulfillment of your experimental
requirement) for your participation in this study, according to the guidelines
of the subject pool and/or your instructor. If you choose not to participate,
you will be offered other opportunities to earn experimental course credit
and/or extra credit in your course, such as video viewing or a short report.
These guidelines will be provided by your instructor and may be listed on your
course syllabus. 

There are no foreseeable
risks to participation in this study. You may choose not to participate, and
you may withdraw at any time during the study procedures without any penalty to
you. In addition, you may choose not to answer any questions with which you are
not entirely comfortable.

 

This research is
confidential. Confidential means that
we will collect information from you, including your gender, age, race and
ethnicity, other expertise, and possibly your IP address, which will remain on
file. This information will not be used to identify you in any way, and your IP
address will not be used for any purposes other than to ensure that you do not
participate in the same study twice. We use this information to understand more
about our findings and the factors involved in language development and
comprehension. Responses and demographic information are collected for all
participants and analyzed to report trends across participants. This
information will be stored in such a manner that some link between your
identity and responses in the research will exist. You will be assigned an
arbitrary code that will be associated with your data. Should an individual
response be used as example, personal identifying information will be removed
beforehand. Please note that we will keep this information confidential by
limiting access to the research data and keeping it in a secure location in our
lab. All electronic files are password-protected. 

 

Our research team and the Institutional Review Board
at Rutgers University are the only parties that will be allowed to see the
data, except as may be required by law. If a report of this study is published,
or the results are presented at a professional conference, no results that can
be linked to an individual will be presented. All study data will be kept for
the duration of the study and its publication for a finite period of time
between three and ten years.
